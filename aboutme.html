    <h1> Karen Sanchez :^) </h1>
    <p> Hello, my name is Karen Sanchez and I am a current member of GWC. Coding is very new for me but learning all of this new information is very fun. I was born and raised in Hayward,CA in a family of five. I have one dog named chela who is eight years old. I am 17 years on and going on to my senior year, which sounds very exciting because I am ready to get out of highschool and try and do things by myself. I hope that once I am finished with GWC, I can use these skills in the real world. </p>
