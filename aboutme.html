    <h2><font color="white"> BIOGRAPHY </font> </h2>
    <p><font color="white"> Hello, my name is Karen Sanchez and I am a current member of GWC. Coding is very new for me but learning all of this new information is very fun. I was born and raised in Hayward,CA in a family of five. I have one dog named chela who is eight years old. I am 17 years on and going on to my senior year, which sounds very exciting because I am ready to get out of highschool and try and do things by myself. I hope that once I am finished with GWC, I can use these skills in the real world.</font> </p>
    <h2><font color="white"> FUN FACT</font> </h2>
    <p><font color="white"> I am in two completely differnt kinds of dance classes, so when trying to remember technique, it can be a little bit confusing because I can get the two confused.</font> </p>

   <h2><font color="white"> SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES WITH SCRATCH AND PYTHON</font> </h2>
   <p><font color="white"> Some similarites from scratch and python are that they both use variables and a 'boolean'. I had a lot of trouble with scratch, so I really don't remember much, but I can tell you some differneces. Scratch is color coded, which for some may be easy, for me it was confusing. On python, nothing is color coded so it was faily easy for me to remember and everything was just so much more simple than scratch.</font> </p>
